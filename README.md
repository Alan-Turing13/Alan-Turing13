‬I am a reliable and highly-motivated Java developer with a unique ability to identify effective solutions and make‬
well-grounded and accurate judgements. Having recently graduated from the Software Development bootcamp at‬
Northcoders, I grasp new information with ease and can make sense of complex concepts. My extensive background in jazz‬
‭has honed my ability to think dynamically, adapt quickly to changing circumstances and collaborate seamlessly with diverse‬
‭teams, all of which are critical in the fast-paced world of tech. I’m excited to leverage my refined interpersonal skills - such as‬
‭communication, teamwork and the ability to thrive under pressure - into a role where I can contribute to innovative solutions‬
‭and work effectively in cross-functional teams.‬
