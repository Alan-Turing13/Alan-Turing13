I picked up coding post-pandemic and it very quickly became part of me. I love both the problem-solving and the patience it teaches. 

Currently enrolled on NorthCoders’ Java Development course, I have already upskilled significantly through extensive pair-programming and test-driven development. 

I’m experienced in full-stack development with both Java and Python, using Spring Framework and Django respectively. 

I’m comfortable working with JUnit, ORMs (Hibernate), SQL, AWS, Docker and GitHub. I have built React and browser-based Javascript apps. 

There are also many transferable skills I carry over from being a full-time musician, most notably: leadership & team-building, self-led problem-solving, spontaneity and how to handle fluctuating emotional states within a team.
